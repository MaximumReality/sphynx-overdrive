# Maximum Reality Game 🎮🐈‍⬛

Welcome to **Maximum Reality**, a neon-drenched, cyber-cat arcade game featuring:

- 🏙 Procedurally generated neon city skyline  
- 🦋 Flying butterflies and particle overlays  
- 🔥 Firewalls and data nodes to collect  
- 🐈‍⬛ Mochkil, the snack-stealing mischief-maker  
- 😸  Hacker cat you control with your mouse  
- 💻 Holographic news desk cameo by Azul

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Move your mouse horizontally to control the cat.  
3. Avoid **firewalls**, collect **data nodes**, and watch Mochkil snatch extra points.  
4. Survive as long as you can — the game ends when your **NODES** reach 0.  
5. Click **REBOOT** to restart after a crash.  

**Tip:** Activate Overdrive mode for 5 seconds of chaos by calling `activateOverdrive()` in the console!
